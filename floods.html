            The flood submerged several parts of the city, affecting more than 100,000 people and killing at least 15.
            The flood also damaged property, crops, and infrastructure. The state government declared Lucknow as one of
            the 11 districts affected by floods and deployed army units and helicopters to rescue and provide relief to
            the affected people. The rainfall increased the water level of the Gomti River, which rose above the danger
            mark of 8.5 metres (28 ft) at Lucknow.

            rainfall in the monsoon season, which made the Gomti River overflow its banks and inundate many parts of the
            city. The flood affected the old city, the civil lines, and the cantonment areas. It damaged property,
            crops, and infrastructure, and forced many people to take shelter in higher places. The flood also disrupted
            the communication and transportation systems, and posed a threat to public health and safety.The flood
